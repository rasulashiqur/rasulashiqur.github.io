 I started my career in academia as an adjunct lecturer at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and then joined in a lecturer at Southeast University. After coming to Gatech, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for Fall 24 semester.
