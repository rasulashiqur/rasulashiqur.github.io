    subtitle: "Hello! This is Ashiqur! I'm a 1st year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interest lies at the intersection of ML algorithm, efficient ML hardware design and neuromorphic computing in both analog and digital domain.
     I am currently a part of Low-power, Adaptive and Resilient Systems Lab (LARS) at Georgia Tech,
     working under the supervision of [Dr. Abhijit Chatterjee](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/abhijit-chatterjee).

     <br><br>
     My research projects at Georgia Tech involves exploring the exciting areas of hardware-software codesign - input adaptive algorithm for efficient machine learning and analog or digital hardware design exploration for this purpose. 
     We work in collaboration with prominent semiconductor companies such Intel, Texas Instruments and research organizations like Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC).   

     <br><br>
     Before coming to Purdue, I completed my Bachelor's degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and went to Notre Dame College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
     When I am not in-front of the computer screen, I maybe playing soccer, roaming around or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

     <br> <br>

     I am looking for internship positions in hardware design for summer 26. I will be happy to connect with you!"
